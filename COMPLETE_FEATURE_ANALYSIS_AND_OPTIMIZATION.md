## ‚ö° **OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY BY FEATURE**

### üîê **Authentication Optimization**
```sql
-- User session indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sessions_expire_cleanup ON sessions(expire);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_last_workout ON users(last_workout_date DESC);
```

### üí™ **Workout System Optimization**
```sql
-- Exercise and deck performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_exercises_category_difficulty ON exercises(category, difficulty);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_deck_exercises_order ON deck_exercises(deck_id, "order");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_workouts_user_date ON workouts(user_id, started_at DESC);
```

### üéØ **Gamification Optimization**
```sql
-- Achievement and progress tracking
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_achievements_unlocked ON user_achievements(user_id, unlocked_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_streak ON users(current_streak DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leaderboards_week_xp ON leaderboards(week_start, weekly_xp DESC);
```
