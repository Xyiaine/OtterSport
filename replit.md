# OtterSport - Fitness Card Game Application

## Overview

OtterSport is a minimalist, card-based fitness game that helps users build consistent daily workout habits. The application features a React frontend with TypeScript, an Express.js backend, and uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence. The system includes user authentication via Replit's OAuth, adaptive workout progression, and comprehensive fitness tracking.

- **Solution**: Custom React components with mobile-optimized design
- **Implementation**: Tailwind CSS with responsive breakpoints, touch-friendly interactions
- **Benefits**: Excellent mobile experience, consistent design system

## Data Flow

### User Onboarding Flow
1. User authenticates via Replit OAuth
2. Onboarding process captures fitness goals, experience level, and frequency preferences
3. System generates personalized base difficulty level
4. User completes starter workout for initial calibration
5. Adaptive engine adjusts difficulty based on initial feedback

### Workout Execution Flow
1. User selects or is recommended a workout deck
2. System calculates exercise parameters based on current difficulty level
3. User completes exercises one by one with real-time timers
4. Post-workout feedback collection for adaptive adjustment
5. Progress tracking and achievement updates

### Adaptive Progression Loop
1. User provides workout feedback (too easy/just right/too hard)
2. Adaptive engine processes feedback with historical patterns
3. Difficulty level adjustment calculation
4. Next workout parameters updated automatically
5. Long-term progress tracking and goal reassessment
